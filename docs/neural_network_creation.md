# **Edge Creation, Layer Creation, and Neuron Creation in Neural Networks Based on Similarity**

## **Introduction**

In neural network design, **edge creation**, **layer creation**, and **neuron creation** can be used to enhance the network's architecture by leveraging neuron similarity. These techniques help in **increasing connectivity**, **grouping neurons**, and **creating new neurons**, respectively, based on similarity. While these concepts share similarities, they serve **distinct purposes** and involve different operations.

Below is a comparison and a deeper dive into the differences and connections between **edge creation**, **layer creation**, and **neuron creation**.

## **Differences Between Edge Creation, Layer Creation, and Neuron Creation**

### **1. Edge Creation**

- **Objective**: The primary goal of **edge creation** is to **increase connectivity** between neurons that are not directly connected but exhibit high similarity. This helps the network explore latent relationships between neurons or features.
- **Operation**: New **edges** are introduced between **individual neurons**, either within the same layer or between adjacent layers, based on similarity.
- **Outcome**: The result is **denser connectivity** between neurons, but **no new layer** is created. Only new connections (edges) are added between existing neurons.

#### **Mathematical Formulation**:
The similarity between two neurons \(i\) and \(j\) can be computed using a similarity measure such as **cosine similarity**:

$$
\text{Cosine Similarity}(i, j) = \frac{\mathbf{a_i} \cdot \mathbf{a_j}}{\|\mathbf{a_i}\| \|\mathbf{a_j}\|}
$$

New edges are created if the similarity exceeds a predefined threshold \(\alpha\):

$$
\text{if} \, \text{Cosine Similarity}(i, j) > \alpha \quad \text{then add edge}(i, j)
$$

### **2. Layer Creation**

- **Objective**: The aim of **layer creation** is to **group neurons** from adjacent layers that exhibit high similarity. This results in the formation of new **intermediate layers** that combine similar neurons across the layers.
- **Operation**: Neurons from two adjacent layers are grouped together based on their similarity, and these similar neurons are aggregated into a new layer.
- **Outcome**: A **new layer** is formed by combining neurons from two layers, which may increase the network's expressiveness.

#### **Mathematical Formulation**:
Similar to edge creation, the **cosine similarity** between neurons in two adjacent layers \(l_1\) and \(l_2\) is calculated:

$$
\text{Cosine Similarity}(i, j) = \frac{\mathbf{a_i} \cdot \mathbf{a_j}}{\|\mathbf{a_i}\| \|\mathbf{a_j}\|}
$$

Neurons from \(l_1\) and \(l_2\) are grouped together into a new layer if their similarity exceeds a threshold \(\alpha\).

### **3. Neuron Creation**

- **Objective**: **Neuron creation** is aimed at **introducing new neurons** into the network by leveraging **similarity** between neurons. New neurons are created by aggregating existing neurons based on similarity metrics.
- **Operation**: A **new neuron** is created by aggregating features from multiple similar neurons (either within the same layer or across layers). The similarity of the neurons is calculated, and if they are similar enough, a new neuron is formed that captures the combined characteristics of the original neurons.
- **Outcome**: New neurons are introduced, resulting in a network architecture with an enhanced feature representation that potentially captures more complex relationships.

#### **Mathematical Formulation**:
Similar to the previous methods, the similarity between neurons \(i\) and \(j\) is calculated. If their similarity exceeds a threshold \(\alpha\), a new neuron \(n\) is created as a **weighted sum** or **average** of the features of \(i\) and \(j\):

$$
\text{Neuron Creation:} \quad \mathbf{n} = \lambda \mathbf{a_i} + (1-\lambda) \mathbf{a_j}
$$

where \(\lambda \in [0, 1]\) is a weighting factor that defines the contribution of neurons \(i\) and \(j\) to the new neuron \(n\).
